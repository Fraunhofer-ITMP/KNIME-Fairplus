# KNIME_Fairplus
 
In this folder are collected the KNIME workflows, which we developed during ITMP activity in FAIRplus project.
The scope of the workflows, in different versions, was to scrap data from IMI project website and use them to scorecards generation. These scorecards have been genrated to assess some features of each project.
